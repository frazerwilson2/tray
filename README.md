# Tray techincal test

## approach:
    - I have tried to focus on keeping each page module and easy to scale/edit. 
    - Each input contains its own validation logic so can easily be moved to another page without any other dependencies, but will still block progress if not completed.
    - have aimed to keep pages readable as to what they do, with most of the logic handled in reusable components

## to run:
    - 'npm run start' to see app
    - 'npm run test' for tests

## considerations:
    - there are various things i have not been able to do due to time limitations,
    such as linting checks, more styles, full type checking and more tests. 
    Hopefully this sample shows a steer on approach.
